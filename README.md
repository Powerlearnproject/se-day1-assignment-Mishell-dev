Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
A)Software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software.
1.Reliability- it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare ,finance. 
2.Efficiency - it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
3.Scalability and flexibility - it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.
4.Security - implement protection practice like authentication, authorization and encryption to secure users information. 

B)Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.Mastering complexity
2.Mastering process
3.Mastering machine

C)List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 1.Planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
 2.Requirement analysis - identify the final user specification. 
 3.Design - building the framework. 
 4.Coding - converting software design into tangible code.
 5.Testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches

D)Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
*Waterfall methodology - Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. 
- There is Low flexibility,
- Changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
- Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
- Testing is done at the end of the development process.

*Agile methodology - Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints). 
- High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 
- Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.

E)Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.Software Developer - developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
 - maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 
- collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.
 - reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
2.Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
 - create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow
 - confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment. 
- analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient. 
- develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.
3.Project Manager - assembles and lead the software development team.
 - discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers.
 - create blueprint for the project.
 - tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
 - deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.

F)Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
